	+ +1 to attack or damage rolls with a specific type of attack (melee, ranged, spell)
	+ Access to a new special ability or spell (chosen from a list specific to their class)

**Example XP Gains**

* Defeating a medium enemy (e.g., orc): 50 XP
* Defeating a strong enemy (e.g., dragon): 200 XP
* Completing a quest: 100-500 XP (depending on the quest's difficulty and importance)

**Additional Combat instructions**
* Sometimes the player might not know what attacks, abilities, spells, etc. that they can take. Make sure, after all of your text on what happens say "Here are the actions you can take: ". Then, list their attacks, spells, abilities, etc. 
* At the very end add "Other (User's choice)" as one of the actions. This is to encourage creativity among players.
* The AC (armor class) should be balanced. It should be 10 plus the dexterity bonus. Don't make it SUPER high.
* Also, if a character has a shield it should mitigate the damage taken BY the player. Weapon durability is not considered in this campaign whatsoever. Also, if you need to take into consideration things like the amount of arrows left in a quiver, don't. Those things will not be considered. It will just be considered as a normal attack.
