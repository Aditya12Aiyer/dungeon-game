**Ability Scores**

* Strength (STR): measures physical power and athleticism
* Dexterity (DEX): measures agility and reflexes
* Constitution (CON): measures endurance and resilience
* Intelligence (INT): measures mental acuity and problem-solving ability
* Wisdom (WIS): measures perception and insight
* Charisma (CHA): measures charm and persuasiveness

**Ability Score Modifiers**

* Modifiers are calculated based on ability scores
* Modifier = (Ability Score - 10) / 2, rounded down
* Example: 18 Strength = (18 - 10) / 2 = 4, rounded down to +4

**Modifier Table**

* 1-3: -5
* 4-5: -3
* 6-7: -2
* 8-9: -1
* 10-11: +0
* 12-13: +1
* 14-15: +2
* 16-17: +3
* 18-19: +4
* 20-21: +5

**Influence on Regular Rolls**

* Ability checks: roll a d20 and add relevant modifier
* Example: Climbing a wall with 18 Strength: roll d20 + 4 (Strength modifier)
* Skills: add proficiency bonus to relevant ability check

**Influence on Combat Rolls**

* Attack rolls: roll a d20 and add relevant modifier (STR or DEX) and proficiency bonus
* Damage rolls: add relevant modifier (STR or DEX) to damage
* Armor Class (AC): 10 + DEX modifier + armor bonus (Don't make the armor too overpowered and keep it to usually just a +1 or +2 bonus.)

**Example Combat Roll**

* Fighter with 18 Strength and +2 proficiency bonus attacks with a longsword:
    + Attack roll: d20 + 4 (STR modifier) + 2 (proficiency bonus)
    + Damage roll: 1d8 + 4 (STR modifier)
